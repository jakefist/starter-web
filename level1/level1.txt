I’ve often said that opinions are like butts — everybody has one.

And when it comes to barbecue, nearly everyone has an opinion. My views will likely cause a slew of debate, but one thing is certain: cooking and eating great barbecue is nothing short of delicious. Whew, at least we can all agree on one thing.

Being from Nashville, I tend to liken everything to music. So, in the band of barbecue brothers, I like to say that ribs have long served as the lead singer of the group — beloved by all, but quite finicky in terms of preparation and consistency. Lately, beef brisket has served as the lead guitarist — earnestly trying to snag some of the spotlight, but still a notch down in overall popularity. My barbecue preference tends to shun the bright lights altogether, focusing more attention on those towards the back of the stage — call ‘em the bassist or drummer — humbly keeping everybody in time with a steady beat of consistency. I’m talking about the pork butt.
