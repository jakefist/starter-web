I thought it important to set out on the open road — and the friendly skies — to explore how this cut is cooked throughout all twelve states of the commonly agreed upon, yet still debated, “barbecue belt.” What I discovered is that no two butts are alike. Along the way, I ate a lot of great food, and of course, garnered some incredible secrets and recipes. Most importantly, I met a lot of the great pitmasters, men and women alike, from all walks of life and heritage, who carry on the grand tradition and responsibility of cooking up and serving great southern barbecue.

In the recipes that follow, I’m sharing my guide on how to make the most of your butts. As you will soon discover, the cut is ultimately forgiving, approachable, and downright delicious. So, here’s a sneak peak into some of the stories and recipes featured in my new book, The South’s Best Butts: Pitmaster Secrets for Southern Barbecue Perfection.
