Pulled, chopped, sliced, dry rubbed, or sauced, I believe that the pork butt is the veritable cornerstone of southern barbecue. It’s a humble cut — better said, cheap — but when cooked low and slow, or potentially hot and rather fast, you’ll soon discover that the tender, delicate meat can be transcending. Incredibly versatile, the yield from a pork butt is just as good sandwiched between white bread or tortillas, as it is a hefty topping for loaded nachos or a steamy bowl of ramen. The pork butt does not discriminate, it simply adds a heavy dose of love wherever it appears.
