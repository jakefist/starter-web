The Cut

What’s in a name? Well, for those thinking that the pork butt comes from the rear, you are mistaken. Pork butts are actually derived from the pork shoulder. Rumor has it that back in the day, these shoulder cuts were salted and preserved and packed in barrels. The packed barrels, or butts as they were called, soon lent their name to their contents as well — and what’s now most commonly called a pork butt, or Boston butt, was born.

Typically found in 10-12 lb. hunks, containing the shoulder bone, I often find my butts at most grocery stores for less than a buck a pound — probably one of the cheapest sources of protein you can find these days. The yield from a properly cooked butt can certainly serve an entire family and friends — usually yielding plenty of leftovers.
