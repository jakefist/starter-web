Equipment

My kitchen philosophy has always revolved around simplicity. I’m a big believer that one does not need to possess a bunch of fancy, expensive equipment to churn out a great meal. Fortunately, that philosophy was only reinforced throughout my travels.

Though I certainly encountered commercial smokers that run into the tens of thousands of dollars, I also came across many cinder block pits, fastened with steel plates welded by hand. The truth is, both devices have the potential to create either great or subpar barbecue.
